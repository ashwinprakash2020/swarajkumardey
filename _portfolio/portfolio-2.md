This study evaluates the fiscal health of the Indian state of Assam over a five-year period from
2020–21 to 2024–25 using key indicators: revenue deficit, fiscal deficit, primary deficit, and interest
expenditure. Each metric is analyzed as a percentage of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) or
revenue expenditure to enable meaningful comparisons over time. Drawing on official data sources
compiled by EPWRF India Time Series (EPWRFITS), the analysis reveals a fluctuating but generally
improving fiscal situation. After a sharp deterioration during the pandemic recovery years character-
ized by high deficits and rising borrowing the state shows signs of fiscal consolidation, with reduced
deficits and apparent control over spending. However, inconsistencies in data, especially regarding
interest expenditure, highlight the need for better fiscal transparency and accounting practices to
ensure the reliability of reported figures and inform sound policymaking.
