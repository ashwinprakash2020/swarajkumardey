Swaraj Kumar Dey holds a B. Tech degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from NIT Durgapur. After completing his undergraduate studies, he worked at IBM India Private Limited. Seeking to broaden his understanding beyond the technical realm, he pursued an MBA from IIM Kozhikode, where he developed a keen interest in the intersection of business and management. His academic journey did not stop there; he went on to complete a PhD in Economics from the same institution.

Swaraj’s research interests are diverse and multifaceted, predominantly focusing on political economy, behavioural economics, and the application of game theory to understanding political and economic institutions. His dissertation delved into these areas and expanded into the domain of information economics, examining the role of social media in today’s economic and political landscape. Through his work Swaraj wants to integrate traditional economic theories with contemporary issues, so that his research is highly relevant to current global dynamics.
