excerpt: "When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down ‘happy’. They told me I didn’t understand the assignment, and I told them they didn’t understand life."

The elusive search for happiness is something that has been troubling the human soul throughout much of history from ancient times to today. What does it mean to be happy, when happiness itself is a subjective quality whose definition varies from person to person? Philosophers across geographies and time have grappled with this question. From ancient Greek and Chinese philosophers and their search for liberty, freedom and enlightenment to modern marketing campaigns of hedonistic pleasure, we all want the golden elixir of life; to lead a happy, blissful existence. But what does it mean to lead a happy life? The various components are sometimes self-contradictory, many times confusing and often inscrutable and variable. To puzzle around this enigma that is also the central question of our existence, this paper attempts an extensive review of literature across different cultures and geographies. The critical review progresses on two different fronts: the predominant Western viewpoint of happiness and the Oriental conceptualization of happiness. We then have ventured to reconceptualise happiness as a reconciliation of the conflicting viewpoints on happiness.
