excerpt: 'The ever-expanding reach and grasp of social media and its tendency to increasingly dominate most of our lives makes it an important aspect to study and understand in detail. This literature review attempts to keep track of the changes in social media and the academic literature surrounding it, in order to comprehend how this new technology has changed our lives and how it impacts various sectors of our economy and political governance structures. Ironically, the domain of academic research itself, like other disciplines is reliant on and has been increasingly changed by the impact of social media. Social media is ubiquitous and all-pervasive in its reach, touching all fields from medicine, mental and psychological health, poverty-alleviation measures, governance, political economy, voting behaviour, marketing and branding strategies and surveillance techniques to name a few. A historical review of the origin and evolution of social media, from platforms bringing people together to platforms that shape the social and political narrative, needs to be undertaken through a critical lens. This literature review aims to accomplish this task.'

The ever-expanding reach and grasp of social media and its tendency to increasingly dominate most of our lives makes it an important aspect to study and understand in detail. This literature review attempts to keep track of the changes in social media and the academic literature surrounding it, in order to comprehend how this new technology has changed our lives and how it impacts various sectors of our economy and political governance structures. Ironically, the domain of academic research itself, like other disciplines is reliant on and has been increasingly changed by the impact of social media. Social media is ubiquitous and all-pervasive in its reach, touching all fields from medicine, mental and psychological health, poverty-alleviation measures, governance, political economy, voting behaviour, marketing and branding strategies and surveillance techniques to name a few. A historical review of the origin and evolution of social media, from platforms bringing people together to platforms that shape the social and political narrative, needs to be undertaken through a critical lens. This literature review aims to accomplish this task.
