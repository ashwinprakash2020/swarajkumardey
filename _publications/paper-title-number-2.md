excerpt: 'This research delves into the phenomenon of believing" fake news" and examines whether our cognitive abilities aid in distinguishing truth from falsehood. Involving 500 participants, our findings reveal that Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) performance correlates with the ability to differentiate between fake and real news. By emphasizing the crucial role of identity in susceptibility to and dissemination of fake news, our study extends beyond individual psychology to encompass social psychology, employing the Social Identity Threat Framework to explore how vulnerable groups embrace or distance themselves from their identities. Results suggest that vulnerable caste groups are more prone to believing and sharing fake news, with caste awareness reinforcing group identity and reducing the ability to discern misinformation. Additionally, vulnerable groups exhibit a preference for social media platforms that either conceal their identity or feature a closed network structure.'

This research delves into the phenomenon of believing "fake news" and examines whether our cognitive abilities aid in distinguishing truth from falsehood. Involving 500 participants, our findings reveal that Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) performance correlates with the ability to differentiate between fake and real news. By emphasizing the crucial role of identity in susceptibility to and dissemination of fake news, our study extends beyond individual psychology to encompass social psychology, employing the Social Identity Threat Framework to explore how vulnerable groups embrace or distance themselves from their identities. Results suggest that vulnerable caste groups are more prone to believing and sharing fake news, with caste awareness reinforcing group identity and reducing the ability to discern misinformation. Additionally, vulnerable groups exhibit a preference for social media platforms that either conceal their identity or feature a closed network structure
