excerpt: "This study examines the differential effects of exposure to adverse information about a favoured candidate on voters' political choice. Using a novel experimental design comprising 500 participants, our research unveils a tipping point, when voters are forced to reconsider their choices, challenging the existence of perpetual motivated reasoning. We find that vulnerable socioeconomic and linguistic groups exhibit higher tipping points, the traditionally conservative NDA coalition is found to tip later and primarily on non-economic issues. Moreover, women are found to not only tip against the candidate but also abandon their preferred political party altogether."

When exposed to repeated incongruent information about the stated position of a favoured candidate, the feeling of betrayal that voter's experience not only induces them to change their voting decision but also prompts them to partake in political activism. Using the lens of identity and the framework of social psychology, the paper further argues that fear of reprisal holds back vulnerable identity groups from engaging in political activism, in general, and in online political activism (OPA), in particular. Employing an innovative experimental design involving 500 participants, the paper's findings indicate that vulnerable socio-economic and linguistic groups exhibit greater reluctance to participate in OPA compared to their non-vulnerable counterparts.
